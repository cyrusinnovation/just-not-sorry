# Just Not Sorry -- the Gmail Plug-in

## Contributing

### Requests to add or change warning phrases

Please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/defmethodinc/just-not-sorry/issues/new) with your request.

If you're a developer, you're welcome to submit a pull request. Please run the tests before submitting, as they will validate the format of the message.

**NOTE:** All warning phrases must include a link to an article that explains why the phrase could negatively impact someone's message. If available, please also include alternative wording suggestions from the article.

### Development Setup

Prerequisites:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [node.js 12.X+](https://nodejs.org/)

Setup:

- `git clone` the repo
- Run `npm install` in the project root
- Run `npm run build` in the project root to build the extension
- Follow the [instructions on the Chrome docs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) to load the unpacked extension using the build subdirectory
- Go to Gmail and open a compose window
- If you make changes to the code, click the Reload link on the `chrome://extensions` page and then reload your Gmail tab to pick up the changes.
- Errors will show up in the console

### Coding Standards

Use [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) with the AirBnB preset.

### Commit Message Conventions

Commit messages are required to follow the [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). This allows us to automatically increment the version numbering of the extension using the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) standard and generate release notes. We use the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) library to provide interactive prompts to help generate the commit messages. Once you've run `npm install` as instructed in the development setup section, Commitizen will be run whenever you execute the `git commit` command.

### Jasmine Tests

Tests are written using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). They can either be run from the command line using headless chrome or run within a browser window.

To run the headless tests, use:

```
npm test
```

To run the tests in the browser, use:

```
npm run test:watch
```

and then open http://localhost:8888 in a web browser.

### To Publish a New Version to Chrome Webstore

This project uses the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) library and [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) to automate the release process. Once a pull request has been merged into the master branch, a new [GitHub release](https://github.com/defmethodinc/just-not-sorry/releases) will be created. A zip file containing the updated files for the Chrome web store will be attached.

To publish this release, download the zip file from GitHub. Find the Just Not Sorry extension on the [Chrome Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/) (credentials available to DefMethod developers upon request), upload the zip file, and click the "Publish Item" button.
